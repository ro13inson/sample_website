    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
      <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
        <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
        command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
        everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
        Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
       We believe there are <strong><em>at least a billion people</em></strong> who can benefit from
       learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our
       movement, <a href="https://learnenough.com/email">sign up for our official email list</a> now.

       HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
       Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
       share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

      addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one:

    <blockquote style="padding: 2px 20px; background: #f7f6eb;">
      <p>
        <em>Don't believe every quote you read on the Internet.</em>
        <br>
        --Abraham Lincoln

    Michael is the creator of the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">
    Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
    <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
    introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
    <a href="https://www.kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
    plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
    are slightly exaggerated.

    <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>
      <p>
        When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
        on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
        interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
        interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.
      </p>

    <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>
      <p>
        You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
